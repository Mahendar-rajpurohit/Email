1. POP Error: "Authentication Failed"  
Cause:  
Incorrect username or password.  
POP access is not enabled in the email account settings.  
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled without generating an app-specific password.  
Solution:  
Verify the username and password.  
Enable POP access in the email account settings. For example, in Gmail, check the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" section.  
If using 2FA, generate an app-specific password from the account's security settings and use it in the email client.  

2. POP Error: "Cannot Connect to Server"  
Cause:  
Incorrect POP server settings (hostname or port).  
Firewall or antivirus is blocking the POP port.  
Network connectivity issues.  
Solution:  
Ensure the correct server settings are used: Gmail: pop.gmail.com (Port 995, SSL enabled), Outlook: outlook.office365.com (Port 995, SSL enabled).  
Temporarily disable firewall or antivirus software and retry.  
Check the internet connection and retry after ensuring a stable network.  

3. POP Error: "Connection Timed Out"  
Cause:  
Slow or unstable internet connection.  
The server is not responding.  
Solution:  
Check your internet connection and switch to a more stable network if necessary.  
Increase the timeout duration in your email client settings.  
Confirm that the POP server is operational. If it's down, retry later.  

4. POP Error: "Unable to Retrieve Emails"  
Cause:  
Emails have already been downloaded and removed from the server.  
POP protocol settings are configured to delete emails after retrieval.  
Solution:  
Check the email client settings and ensure that emails are not set to be removed from the server after retrieval.  
For Gmail, enable the "Leave a copy of retrieved messages on the server" option in POP settings.  
Use IMAP instead of POP if you need to access emails on multiple devices.  

5. POP Error: "Mailbox Is Locked"  
Cause:  
The email account is already being accessed by another device.  
A previous session did not close properly, leaving the mailbox locked.  
Solution:  
Log out of the email account on all devices and log back in on the primary device.  
Wait for the lock to time out (usually a few minutes).  
Contact the email service provider if the issue persists.  

6. POP Error: "Too Many Connections"  
Cause:  
Multiple devices are trying to retrieve emails simultaneously using the POP protocol.  
Solution:  
Disconnect other devices from the email account.  
Limit the number of simultaneous connections in the email client settings.  

7. POP Error: "Invalid Command"  
Cause:  
Corrupted configuration or unsupported command sent by the email client.  
Solution:  
Remove and re-add the email account in your email client.  
Ensure the email client supports the POP version used by the email server.  

8. POP Error: "Quota Exceeded"  
Cause:  
The mailbox storage quota is full.  
Solution:  
Delete unnecessary emails, especially those with large attachments, to free up space.  
Upgrade the email plan if more storage is needed.  

9. POP Error: "Port Blocked"  
Cause:  
ISP or firewall is blocking the POP port (e.g., Port 110 or 995).  
Solution:  
Confirm with your ISP if the required POP port is open.  
Temporarily disable the firewall or configure it to allow POP connections.  

10. POP Error: "Error 0x800CCC0F"  
Cause:  
Network interruption or server connection reset.  
Large emails causing a timeout.  
Solution:  
Check the internet connection and retry.  
Enable an option in the email client to download emails without attachments.  
Delete or move large emails from the mailbox via the webmail interface.  

Best Practices for POP Configuration  
Use secure ports and protocols: Port 995 with SSL for encrypted communication.  
Keep a copy of retrieved messages on the server for future access.  
Regularly clean up the mailbox to prevent storage-related issues.  
Use IMAP instead of POP if you need email synchronization across multiple devices.
